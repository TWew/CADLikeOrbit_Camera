Zoom and Pan around.

				Name: \"Zooming\", Event: Righ Button
				Name \"Panning\", Event: Middle Button
				Name: \"Rotating\", Event Left Button

To determine the Focalpoint a RayCast-Node is used.
Has the RayCast no Collision  (Mouse is not on
a Pickable Object), Pre-Defined Uservalues are used.
 
To Keep one Mousebutton unused the Combination of the
Pan- and Zoom-Action can be used to trigger the Rotate
 Action."
